This became a settlement for migrants to the Calamianes.</i><b></p></p>

Fishing boats in Coron.
The main industries of Coron are fishing and tourism.[citation needed] Former industries include manganese mining at Singay Mines in Barangay San Nicolas during the Japanese Occupation period. This was followed by the fishing industry boom during the 1970s up to the 1990s which gradually dwindled due to illegal blast and sodium cyanide fishing. The rattan and basket-weaving industry which also gradually declined during the same period due to the ensuing depletion of raw materials.

Currently tourism is the top industry in Coron due to local beaches, dive sites, Lagoons and other natural tourist spots.[22] A dozen sunken Japanese warships at depths between 10 and 40 meters (33 and 131 ft) off Coron Island is a diving destination,[8] listed in Forbes Traveler Magazine’s top 10 best scuba diving sites in the world.[citation needed] A description of the diving highlights in 2021 is provided by Dive the World.[23]</i><b></p></p>
